FCCSW Generation Package Documentation
--------------------------------------


The Generation package consists of framework components and utilities to provide the input to the detector simulation stage of the software.
The currently available implementations are sparse and will not cover every usecase -- an effort is underway to refactor generic parts of the software of LHC experiments, but the current code illustrates the use of the event store and other framework features. The most basic usecases -- i/o from a HepMC-file, a particle gun and an interface to the Pythia event generator -- are nonetheless available. Refer to the doxygen pages and examples for details.
